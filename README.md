# spam-message-detector

This is one of my first ML projects. In it, I vectorized a text dataset(converted it into a bunch of numbers for the computer to understand) and plugged it into a Machine Learning model(Naive Bayes) to train it to recognize spam. Once done, I tested the model's accuracy and plugged in my own messages to test it out.
